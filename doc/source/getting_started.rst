Getting started
***************

The streamm package includes modules to manipulate and concactinate atomic structures,
create input files for simulations, track the simulation's progress and analyize the results.
Once the package is installed on the system, see :ref:`installation_instructions`.

Molecular Structure
===================

First lets create some structure objects and make some molecules. 

Quantum Chemistry
==================


Molecular Dynamics
==================

Let's replicate our molecules into a simulation cell and run some MD.
