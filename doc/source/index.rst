STREAMM (Simulation Toolkit for Renewable Energy and Advanced Materials Modeling)
================================================================================================

Advanced materials are important for a number of cutting edge renewable energy applications.
These applications include organic polymer photovoltaics, thermoelectrics and organic radical batteries
to name a few.
To optimize performance requires novel synthesis and device fabrication that spans a large parameter
space, making it a challenge to make progress using only experimental investigation. Modeling and numerical
simulation needs to be an integral part of the search for these critical materials.

The energy applications mentioned above combine a need to understand materials on a range of length and energy scales that
requires a number of different kinds of simulation methodologies and codes. STREAMM is a framework of python modules
that enables

- data containers that allow transfer between quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics simulations
- integration with analysis and visualization algorithms (both internal and third-party)
- an object-oriented framework for extending the functionality to specific needs
