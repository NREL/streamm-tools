STREAMM (Simulation Toolkit for Renewable Energy and Advanced Materials Modeling)
================================================================================================

Advanced materials are important for a number of cutting edge renewable energy applications.
These applications include organic polymer photovoltaics, thermoelectrics and organic radical batteries
to name a few. The optimal synthesis of these materials and device fabrication spans a large parameter
space that is a challenge for progress using only experimental investigation. Modeling and numerical
simulation needs to be an integral part of the search for these critical materials.

The energy applications mentioned above combine a need to understand materials on a range of length and energy scales that
requires a number of different kinds of simulation methodologies and codes. STREAMM is a framework of python modules
that enables

- data containers that allow transfer between quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics simulations
- integration with analysis and visualization algorithms (both internal and third-party)
- an object-oriented framework for extending the functionality to specific needs
