STREAMM (Simulation Toolkit for Renewable Energy and Advanced
Materials Modeling) is a framework for running quantum chemical
calculations and molecular dynamics simulations of molecular
systems. The main features include:

1. Classes for molecular structures and force-field parameters.
2. Property dictionaries for each class for easy data analysis and
   integration with data analysis tools such as pandas.
3. Workflow classes including calculations and resources.
4. Analysis of time series results from molecular dynamics simulations
including radial distribution functions.
