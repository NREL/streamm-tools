The tdfilt.py contains edits for extracting exciting state / dipole info
The other versions of tdfilt.py are kept for now for easy comparisons /editing.

For change log papooses, the only changes were to augment the "if" statement on line 149, to add a
block that gets the excited state dipole from lines 161-171 and to add output of the
excited state dipole information in the .json file on lines 260-263.
